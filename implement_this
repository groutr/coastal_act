1. Install Python Anaconda in your home directory, see: https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Anaconda

2. Install the AWS Command Line Interface (awscli). This is a Python program, so you install it using the Anaconda package manager. Note: This installs packages from a local mirror that has been set up on Hera:

   $ conda install awscli

3. Verify that it is correctly installed

   $ which aws

4. Configure access to CWWED on AWS S3 cloud storage. Use the “aws_access_key_id” and “aws_secret_access_key” provided by Danny. Use “region” = “us-east-1”:

   $ aws configure --profile nsem

This configuration is stored in ~/.aws

5. The awscli program has a fixed syntax:

   $ aws <service> <operation>

6. The cloud storage S3 service has a number of typical file transfer operations (e.g. ls, cp, sync). For the full list, see:

   $ aws s3 help

7. To inspect the CWWED database on AWS S3 (remember to add your access profile “nsem”):

   $ aws s3 ls s3://cwwed-shared/nsem/DHC/Florence/ --profile nsem
                           PRE Mobile Mesonet/
                           PRE Soundings/
                           PRE pressure/
                           PRE radar/
                           PRE wind/

Note: AWS S3 uses the concept of prefixes (“PRE”) instead of subfolders. Just think of a prefix as equivalent to a subfolder in a conventional filesystem.

8. To download directories and files, use the sync command:

 $ aws s3 sync s3://cwwed-shared/nsem/DHC/Florence/ local_dir/ --profile nsem
